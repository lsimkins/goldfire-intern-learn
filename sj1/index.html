  Project Step 1: Basic Object Setup
    Draws a rectangle to the canvas.

  In this first project, we have 2 scripts.
  The first script creates a function and assigns it to the global variable "SjButton"
  That function does 3 things:
    1. Creates a function called "init" and stores a reference to it.
    2. Creates a function called "render" and stores a reference to it.
    3. Calls the newly created "init" function.

  The second script does 4 things:
    1. Creates a global variable called "gameCanvas" that references the game canvas.
    2. Gets a reference the the gameCanvas's context and assigns it to a variable called "ctx".
    3. Creates a new SjButton by calling "new SjButton(x,y,width,height)" and assigns it to the variable "btn"
    4. Calls the render() function of the new SjButton and sends it the ctx reference so it can draw to the canvas.

  After studying this code:
  Uncomment the last line of code and open your console to see the difference between SjButton and btn.
  Play around with adding addtional functionality to the button.

      <script>
        // Here we create a function and assign it to the global variable "SjButton."
        // Here's the confusing part: functions are just extended Objects in javascript,
        // where the function is called as the constructor when you call "new SjButton()."
        // 
        // See the code below where I create a new button for more explanation.
        SjButton = function(x, y, width, height) {
          /**
           * Initializes this object.
           */
          this.init = function(x, y, width, height) {
            // Saves the references to x,y,width, and height,
            // turning them into this object's "properties"
            this.x = x;
            this.y = y;
            this.width = width;
            this.height = height;
          }

          /**
           * Renders the button on the screen.
           * @return {SjButton}
           */
          this.render = function(ctx) {
            ctx.fillStyle = '#aaaaaa';
            ctx.strokeStyle = "#ffffff";

            ctx.fillRect(this.x, this.y, this.width, this.height);
            ctx.stroke();
          }

          // Here I call the init() function we've created above. I do it this way because creating an init()
          // function is a standard within games. When we set up our mock class-based inheritance structure later,
          // you won't see this because it it will happen lower in the inheritance structure.
          this.init(x, y, width, height);
        }
      </script>

      <script>
        // When we make a variable assingment without writing "var" first,
        // the variable has a "global" scope. This means it can be accessed globally everywhere
        // after it is created.  Here we're creating a global reference to the game canvas that
        // so all code can have access to it.
        gameCanvas = document.getElementById('game_canvas');

        // When we create a variable using "var," the variable has "local" scope. That means that
        // as soon as the script ends (at the closing /script tag), we can no longer access the variable.
        // The same goes for variable declared inside a function, after the closing "}" the variable reference
        // disappears.
        var ctx = gameCanvas.getContext('2d');

        // Now I'm creating a new button.  When I call "new SjButton()," it is calling SjButton as a function like
        // you see above, AND creating a copy of the SJButton. But when the function is called, all those
        // functions and varibles inside that function are created on the function call,
        // as if we were initializing a new object. I'm sure that all sounds very confusing, but as you use this stuff
        // more it'll become clearer and clearer.
        var btn = new SjButton(180, 20, 140, 60);

        // Calling the render method (function) of my newly created button.
        btn.render(ctx);

        // Uncomment these lines after studying the above code and study the differences between
        // SjButton and the newly created button. You'll see that SjButton is only a function,
        // while "btn" has the functions and properties that function creates when being called.
        //console.log("SjButton: ", SjButton);
        //console.log("btn: ", btn);
