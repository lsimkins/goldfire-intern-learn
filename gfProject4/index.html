  Project 4: Creating a Start Screen and Spritesheet.
    Be prepared, we'll be taking a large step in this next project.

    1. That button we created earlier is now going to be used as the start button in
      a start screen.  I'm going to keep my button very basic, but

      // We no longer create a global reference to the canvas. The engine will now take the
      // responsibility of passing the proper references to the game objects. Also notice that
      // we no longer get the canvas context here. The engine will handle all of that work.
      var gameCanvas = document.getElementById('game_canvas');

      // Create a new instance of the engine and pass it a reference to the game canvas.
      new GfEngine(gameCanvas);

      // Create a new player. For now we're creating a globally-accessible player. (notice the lack of "var")
      // This is for demo purposes. In the future, the player won't be created this way.
      GamePlayer = new Player(50, 50);

      // Start the engine.
      // You may be curious what "gf" is. That is actually just the engine we created above. If you take a look
      // inside the engine class, you see that the engine assigns itself to the global "gf" variable.
      // We can easily reach that variable here, since it is available at the global level.
      gf.start(20);

      // The button takes the bench for now. We'll come back to it later.
      //var btn = new SjButton(180, 20, 140, 60);

      //btn.render(ctx);
